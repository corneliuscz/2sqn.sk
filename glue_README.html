<p>Glue is a simple PHP class that maps URLs to classes. The concepts are similar to web.py for Python.</p>

<h1>Pull Requests</h1>
<p>Since creating and publishing GluePHP, I have received a lot of patches and pull requests. Each
modification is vastly different than the other.</p>
<p>GluePHP is a <strong>very</strong> simple PHP script and there are an almost infinite amount of modifications
and alternative styles that can be applied to it. Because of this, I do not accept patches or
pull requests. All patches that I have received have had very good ideas, so I do not think it
would be fair to accept some patches and not others (since most are incompatible with each other).</p>
<p>GluePHP is BSD licensed. By all means, fork the code, hack it up as much as you want, and 
republish it. :)</p>
