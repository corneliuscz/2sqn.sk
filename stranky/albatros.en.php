            <div class="large-12 columns">
                <p>L-39 is a tandem-seat, subsonic jet trainer aircraft. It is designed for basic, follow-on or for other levels of training at which pilots are trained to fly combat aircraft. The aircraft provides the capability to train pilots for advanced flying techniques, aerobatic manoeuvres or air attack training and destruction of air/ground targets. The instrument and radio communication equipment allow the aircraft to perform flight missions under all weather conditions, day and night. A total number of L-39 aircraft the squadron has in its inventory is 9:  5 L-39CM variants and 4 L-39ZAM variants. </p>

                <p>The history of the aircraft L-39 Albatros dates back to 1963 when the Ministry of National Defence of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic drew up an analysis of the documents for setting the requirements on a new training system for jet pilots, as a replace for older type L-29 Delfín. The main project designer was Ing. Jan Vlček and the project head was Ing. Karol Dlouhý. The first real flight which lasted 35 minutes was made by test pilot Ing. Rudolf Duchoň on 4 November 1968. Series production was launched in 1971 in the Aero Vodochody and lasted until 1997. A total number of the aircraft was 2,892. They were produced in various versions and exported to 17 countries. The Soviet Union became the biggest customer of L-39 aircraft by placing an order for 2,081 aircraft.</p>

It was later operated by the Biele Albatrosy and also got the colours of this aerobatic display team. In 1996-1997, the aircraft underwent a general overhaul in the LOTN (Aircraft Repair Company Trenčín) that included both the replacement of the old fuselage shell with the new one and the life-cycle extension. By the late 1990s, the aircraft was operated with older (taller) type of the rudder. The aircraft was later labelled with No. 4, printed in blue and placed on its vertical tail area. In 2002, it underwent another complete overhaul in the LOTN and included extensive upgrade, the change of its serial number from 0101 to 5302 and its transformation into L-39CM. The 2nd Squadron in the AFB Sliač used the aircraft from 2006 to May 2011 when it was grounded for a thorough overhaul.</p>

Later, it got the new type of the rudder and a/the blue number 5 printed on the vertical tail area. In 2002, it was the first aircraft undergoing the general overhaul in the LOTN that included the upgrade of the aircraft instruments and the replacement of the wing, the rear part of the fuselage and the tails for the new ones. Besides, it got a newer model of the vertical tail area with a longer antenna cover atop, which is a typical feature for the Albatros of the series 50 and above. On 26 August 2003, the aircraft made test flight and by April 2004 it was relocated to Košice. On 15 April 2004, the aircraft flew to Sliač, where it was practically grounded because of its upgrade modifications, totally different from all other L-39CMs.  Currently, the aircraft is put out of operation and its serial number has not been changed to 5251 as it was first intended. </p>
